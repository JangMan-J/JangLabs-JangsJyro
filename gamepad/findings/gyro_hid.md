# Gyro HID interface — 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless + general notes

## SDL3 status on the Ultimate 2 Wireless (DInput) — updated 2026-04-20

As of JSM master @ SHA `bb69784488937e0a5e21988b966eccd9f04d504e` with SDL3 @
SHA `5848e584a1b606de26e3dbd1c7e4ecbc34f807a6` (release-3.4.4), SDL3's
`SDL_hidapi_8bitdo.c` driver **does** surface the pad's gyro via
`SDL_SENSOR_GYRO` in DInput mode, at full ±2000 dps scale and ~1000 Hz sample
rate. This supersedes the earlier caveat below that SDL did not plumb sensors
for this pad. The raw-HID path is still the reference for tools that need
direct HID access (e.g. `gyro_meter.py`) — the layout table, scale factors,
and axis mapping elsewhere in this document remain correct for anything that
reads HID directly. The runtime confirmation of this SDL3 plumbing on Linux
(JSM lane) is recorded in `jsm_linux_port.md` and the phase-0 run summaries under `../runs/`.

## Device identification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | Shenzhen 8Bitdo Tech Co., Ltd. |
| VID | 0x2DC8 |
| PID | 0x6012 (controller) / 0x6013 (dongle alone) |
| HID usage page / usage | 0x01 / 0x05 (Generic Desktop / Gamepad) |
| USB | Declares 2.0, runs at Full-Speed (12 Mbit/s) |
| bInterval | 1 ms on both IN and OUT (1000 Hz bus polling) |
| Measured host-side polling | ~1006 Hz avg, 0.10 ms jitter (stdev) |

## Mode map (Ultimate 2 Wireless)

Hold a button during power-on to select:

- **NS / Switch mode — hold Y.** Pad emulates a Nintendo Switch Pro
  Controller: VID 0x057E, PID 0x2009, SDL GUID prefix `0300bb977e05…`.
  Gyro is readable via SDL's `SDL_GameControllerGetSensorData`
  (underlying driver: `HIDAPI_DriverSwitch` in SDL source).
- **DInput mode — hold B.** Native 8BitDo VID/PID. Gyro is embedded
  in the raw HID input report and is NOT surfaced by SDL's
  GameController sensor API. Read via Python `hidapi`.
- **PC / XInput mode — default.** No gyro at all. XInput has no gyro
  axis or sensor API.

## DInput HID report layout (v1.09 firmware)

- Report ID: 0x01
- Total length: 34 bytes (sensor-capable firmware ≥ v1.03)
- Pre-v1.03: 12 bytes, no sensor block. v1.03 was the cutoff that
  added sensors to DInput mode.

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 0      | 1 | Report ID (0x01) |
| 1      | 1 | Header / status (~0x0F) |
| 2      | 1 | L-stick X |
| 3      | 1 | L-stick Y |
| 4      | 1 | R-stick X |
| 5      | 1 | R-stick Y |
| 6      | 1 | L-trigger |
| 7      | 1 | R-trigger |
| 8–13   | 6 | Button bitmap + misc |
| 14     | 1 | Frame header (~0x53) |
| 15–16  | 2 | sAccelX (int16 LE) |
| 17–18  | 2 | sAccelY (int16 LE) |
| 19–20  | 2 | sAccelZ (int16 LE) |
| 21–22  | 2 | sGyroX  (int16 LE) |
| 23–24  | 2 | sGyroY  (int16 LE) |
| 25–26  | 2 | sGyroZ  (int16 LE) |
| 27–33  | 7 | Padding / reserved |

## Actual sensor delivery rate

**~125 Hz** in both 2.4 GHz dongle and Bluetooth paths, despite the
1 ms bus poll interval. Likely the IMU chip is sampling at 125 Hz
internally, OR the dongle firmware coalesces to a BT-like cadence for
protocol symmetry.

Either way: the "1000 Hz gyro" marketing refers to chip spec, not
what reaches the host. Measure the fresh-sample rate from the
application side before trusting the bInterval number.

## Scale factors

```python
GYRO_SCALE  = 2000.0 / 32767.0   # int16 → °/s
ACCEL_SCALE =    1.0 /  4096.0   # int16 → g
```

## Axis mapping (matches SDL driver convention)

Raw HID fields are NOT pitch/yaw/roll directly. Apply:

```python
pitch = -sGyroY
yaw   = +sGyroZ
roll  = -sGyroX

accel_pitch = -sAccelY
accel_yaw   = +sAccelZ
accel_roll  = -sAccelX
```

Using this mapping keeps DInput raw-HID output identical to SDL's
Switch-mode sensor output, so downstream code doesn't have to know
which source is active.

## Integration paths (Windows)

| Method | Applicable when | Output | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| SDL `SDL_GameControllerGetSensorData` | SDL has a HIDAPI driver for this pad (DualSense, Switch Pro, Steam Deck, 8BitDo-as-Switch-Pro) | rad/s | No generic fallback; if the driver doesn't match, gyro is invisible. |
| Raw HID via `hidapi` Python binding | HID interface is accessible | int16 (scale + axis-map as above) | Works for 8BitDo in DInput mode. |
| XInput | Never for gyro | — | Axes only; gyro is not part of XInput protocol. |
| SDL `SDL_JoystickGetAxis` | Always, but only sees axes declared as Generic Desktop in HID descriptor | int16 | 8BitDo in DInput mode declares 6 standard axes (sticks + triggers) and NO gyro axes → SDL Joystick path sees no gyro. |

## Exclusive-access gotchas

- **8BitDo Ultimate Software** (tray app) claims the HID interface
  exclusively while running. `hid.enumerate()` returns empty as long
  as it's alive. Right-click tray → **Exit** (not minimize) to release.
- **Steam Input** hides controllers from SDL while running and
  re-exposes them via Steam's own SDL shim for games it owns.
  Non-Steam apps need to be added as a Non-Steam Shortcut to receive
  Steam Input's forwarded gyro. Otherwise: quit Steam.

## Python `hidapi` vs `hid` packaging footgun

Two PyPI packages both provide a module named `hid`:

- `pip install hidapi` — compiled Cython binding with `hidapi.dll`
  bundled. **Preferred on Windows.**
- `pip install hid` — pure-Python ctypes wrapper. Does NOT bundle the
  DLL. Fails at import time with "DLL load failed" unless libhidapi
  is installed system-wide.

If BOTH are installed, one shadows the other and import behavior is
confused. Fix:

```
pip uninstall -y hid
# keep 'hidapi'
```

API also differs slightly; defensive code should feature-detect:

```python
if hasattr(hid, "Device"):
    # pure-Python 'hid' package
    dev = hid.Device(path=p); data = dev.read(64, timeout=50)
else:
    # Cython 'hidapi' package
    dev = hid.device(); dev.open_path(p); data = dev.read(64, timeout_ms=50)
```

## Generic gyro-controller gotchas

- **SDL gyro support requires a dedicated HIDAPI driver per device.**
  A "generic HID gamepad" entry in SDL's mapping database is NOT
  enough — the driver itself is the sensor layer. Without it,
  `SDL_GameControllerHasSensor()` returns false.
- **HID descriptors declare gyro under varied usage codes.** Typical
  options: extra Generic Desktop axes (rX/rY/rZ, slider, dial),
  Motion usage page 0x05, or vendor-defined pages. SDL's Joystick
  path only picks up Generic Desktop. Motion-page gyro is invisible
  to SDL without a product-specific driver.
- **Advertised polling rate on 2.4 GHz / BT paths is often aspirational.**
  Dongle firmware frequently coalesces samples; measure the
  fresh-sample rate from the application side before trusting the
  spec number.
- **Some 8BitDo pads need a feature report to enable sensors.**
  SF30 Pro, SN30 Pro, Pro 2, Pro 3 use a `0x06` feature report; SDL
  handles this per-product in `SDL_hidapi_8bitdo.c`. The Ultimate 2
  Wireless does NOT — sensors flow automatically on compatible
  firmware.
- **If SDL can't see gyro, the fastest diagnostic is a raw HID byte-
  change probe.** Record HID bytes across three phases (idle, sticks-
  only, rotate-only) and flag bytes whose motion spikes during
  rotate-only. Gyro candidates appear as pairs of adjacent bytes
  (int16 pairs) with high delta-sum during rotate.
